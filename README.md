# âš” Arms

Random Map Scripting for Age of Empires 2.

## â›¨ What is thisâ€½

It's mostly me trying out Rust!

In the future it'll hopefully be a Scenario file generator. You'll be able to
write Arms scripts in Lua or Moonscript, and the Arms app will output a Scenario
file for you.

It'll be aimed mostly at generating Random Map-style scenarios, like an
**A**dvanced **R**andom **M**ap **S**cripting language, with support for
generating triggers and very specific structures.

Something liiiikeâ€¦

(VERY rough draft)

```lua
map:base_terrain(terrain.grass1)

-- like "<PLAYER_SETUP> random_placement"
players:distribute_randomly()
-- but you could also do things like
-- player[1]:position(world.sizeX / 2, world.sizeY / 2)

-- generate elevation ðŸ˜±
world.elevation
  -- keep it flat within 10 tiles of player starting positions
  -- this wouldn't be necessary on a nomad map, for example :)
  :avoid_players(10)
  -- Elevation.* are noise generators.
  :generate(Elevation.mountainy)

for_each_player(function(player)
  local tc = player:place(unit.town_center):at(player.position)
  -- place three villagers at a random location, 3 tiles away from the town center
  -- using `player.starting_villagers` because it'll account for Chinese and
  -- Mayan bonuses.
  player
    :place(unit.villager, player.starting_villagers)
    :near(tc, 3)
  -- place a scout 8 tiles away from the town center
  player:place(unit.scout):near(tc, 8)
  -- place 6 sheep between 10 and 22 tiles away from the town center
  player:place(unit.sheep, 6):near(tc, 10, 22)
end)

-- generating triggers!
trigger()
  :conditions(function(condition)
    condition\is_in_area(player, unit.scout, get_an_area_description_somehow())
  end)
  :effects(function(effect)
    effect\kill_objects('all', get_an_area_description_somehow())
  end)
```
